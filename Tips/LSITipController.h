// Typically don't want to import .h files into other .h files
// so we use a forward class declaration

// Forward Class Declaration (this class's details will be shared later, but I want to use a placeholder for now)
// Helps with build times being faster
// Helps with classes that need to include each other (import cycle)
@class LSITip; // there's a class that I'm going to declare, called LSITip
